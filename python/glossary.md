'In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself'

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing]

# protocol / ABC (Abstract Base Classes)

'So any object, regardless of it’s class/type, can conform to a certain interface just by implementing the expected behavior (methods). These informal interfaces are termed as protocols.'
